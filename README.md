# Graph-Rag-Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of **Graph-RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation)**, inspired by the Microsoft Graph-RAG architecture. This work focuses on enhancing the retriever system for large language models (LLMs), making it more efficient and effective for research purposes.  

---

## **About the Project**  

The implementation was carried out as part of ongoing research under the guidance of **Professor Dr. Zhiqiang Shen**, Assistant Professor of Machine Learning at **Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)**. The project explores the integration of a graph-based retriever system with RAG to improve contextual understanding and response generation in LLMs.  

### **Key Features**  
- Adopts the **Microsoft Graph-RAG architecture** as a foundation for implementation.  
- Incorporates advanced techniques for efficient retrieval and response generation.  
- Designed to be modular and extensible for research and development purposes.  
- Supports seamless integration with various LLMs for experimental evaluation.

## **Objectives**  
- **Research Focus**: Investigate the effectiveness of graph-based retrieval mechanisms in enhancing LLM response accuracy and relevance.  
- **Application**: This implementation serves as a prototype for experiments in retriever-augmented generation systems.
