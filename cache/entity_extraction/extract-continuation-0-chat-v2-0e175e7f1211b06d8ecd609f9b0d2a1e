But don't you tell my father! We should have no\npeace in our place, if that got touched upon. It's my sister's\ncontriving.'\n'You seem to have a good sister.'\n'She ain't half bad,' said the boy; 'but if she knows her letters it's the\nmost she does - and them I learned her.'\nThe gloomy Eugene, with his hands in his pockets, had strolled in and\nassisted at the latter part of the dialogue; when the boy spoke these\nwords slightingly of his sister, he took him roughly enough by the\nchin, and turned up his face to look at it.\n'Well, I'm sure, sir!' said the boy, resisting; 'I hope you'll know me\nagain.'\nEugene vouchsafed no answer; but made the proposal to Mortimer,\n'I'll go with you, if you like?' So, they all three went away together in\nthe vehicle that had brought the boy; the two friends (once boys\ntogether at a public school) inside, smoking cigars; the messenger on\nthe box beside the driver.\n'Let me see,' said Mortimer, as they went along; 'I have been, Eugene,\nupon the honourable roll of solicitors of the High Court of Chancery,\nand attorneys at Common Law, five years; and - except gratuitously\ntaking instructions, on an average once a fortnight, for the will of Lady\nTippins who has nothing to leave - I have had no scrap of business\nbut this romantic business.'\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n22\n'And I,' said Eugene, 'have been ‘called’ seven years, and have had no\nbusiness at all, and never shall have any. And if I had, I shouldn't\nknow how to do it.'\n'I am far from being clear as to the last particular,' returned Mortimer,\nwith great composure, 'that I have much advantage over you.'\n'I hate,' said Eugene, putting his legs up on the opposite seat, 'I hate\nmy profession.'\n'Shall I incommode you, if I put mine up too?' returned Mortimer.\n'Thank you. I hate mine.'\n'It was forced upon me,' said the gloomy Eugene, 'because it was\nunderstood that we wanted a barrister in the family.

And we have got a precious\none.'\n'There are four of us, with our names painted on a door-post in right\nof one black hole called a set of chambers,' said Eugene; 'and each of\nus has the fourth of a clerk - Cassim Baba, in the robber's cave - and\nCassim is the only respectable member of the party.'\n'I am one by myself, one,' said Mortimer, 'high up an awful staircase\ncommanding a burial-ground, and I have a whole clerk to myself, and\nhe has nothing to do but look at the burial-ground, and what he will\nturn out when arrived at maturity, I cannot conceive. Whether, in that\nshabby rook's nest, he is always plotting wisdom, or plotting murder;\nwhether he will grow up, after so much solitary brooding, to enlighten\nhis fellow-creatures, or to poison them; is the only speck of interest\nthat presents itself to my professional view.

If there is a word in the dictionary under any letter from A\nto Z that I abominate, it is energy. It is such a conventional\nsuperstition, such parrot gabble! What the deuce!

Yet that would be energy.'\n'Precisely my view of the case, Eugene.
