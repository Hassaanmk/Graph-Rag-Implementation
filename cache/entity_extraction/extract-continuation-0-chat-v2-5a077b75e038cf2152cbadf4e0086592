Thus. Twemlow had first known Veneering at his\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n10\nclub, where Veneering then knew nobody but the man who made\nthem known to one another, who seemed to be the most intimate\nfriend he had in the world, and whom he had known two days - the\nbond of union between their souls, the nefarious conduct of the\ncommittee respecting the cookery of a fillet of veal, having been\naccidentally cemented at that date. Immediately upon this, Twemlow\nreceived an invitation to dine with Veneering, and dined: the man\nbeing of the party. Immediately upon that, Twemlow received an\ninvitation to dine with the man, and dined: Veneering being of the\nparty. At the man's were a Member, an Engineer, a Payer-off of the\nNational Debt, a Poem on Shakespeare, a Grievance, and a Public\nOffice, who all seem to be utter strangers to Veneering. And yet\nimmediately after that, Twemlow received an invitation to dine at\nVeneerings, expressly to meet the Member, the Engineer, the Payer-off\nof the National Debt, the Poem on Shakespeare, the Grievance, and\nthe Public Office, and, dining, discovered that all of them were the\nmost intimate friends Veneering had in the world, and that the wives\nof all of them (who were all there) were the objects of Mrs Veneering's\nmost devoted affection and tender confidence.\nThus it had come about, that Mr Twemlow had said to himself in his\nlodgings, with his hand to his forehead: 'I must not think of this. This\nis enough to soften any man's brain,' - and yet was always thinking of\nit, and could never form a conclusion.\nThis evening the Veneerings give a banquet. Eleven leaves in the\nTwemlow; fourteen in company all told. Four pigeon-breasted\nretainers in plain clothes stand in line in the hall. A fifth retainer,\nproceeding up the staircase with a mournful air - as who should say,\n'Here is another wretched creature come to dinner; such is life!' -\nannounces, 'Mis-ter Twemlow!'\nMrs Veneering welcomes her sweet Mr Twemlow. Mr Veneering\nwelcomes his dear Twemlow. Mrs Veneering does not expect that Mr\nTwemlow can in nature care much for such insipid things as babies,\nbut so old a friend must please to look at baby. 'Ah! You will know the\nfriend of your family better, Tootleums,' says Mr Veneering, nodding\nemotionally at that new article, 'when you begin to take notice.' He\nthen begs to make his dear Twemlow known to his two friends, Mr\nBoots and Mr Brewer - and clearly has no distinct idea which is\nwhich.\nBut now a fearful circumstance occurs.\n'Mis-ter and Mis-sus Podsnap!'\n'My dear,' says Mr Veneering to Mrs Veneering, with an air of much\nfriendly interest, while the door stands open, 'the Podsnaps.'\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n11\nA too, too smiling large man, with a fatal freshness on him, appearing\nwith his wife, instantly deserts his wife and darts at Twemlow with:\n'How do you do? So glad to know you. Charming house you have here.\nI hope we are not late. So glad of the opportunity, I am sure!'\nWhen the first shock fell upon him, Twemlow twice skipped back in\nhis neat little shoes and his neat little silk stockings of a bygone\nfashion, as if impelled to leap over a sofa behind him; but the large\nman closed with him and proved too strong.\n'Let me,' says the large man, trying to attract the attention of his wife\nin the distance, 'have the pleasure of presenting Mrs Podsnap to her\nhost. She will be,' in his fatal freshness he seems to find perpetual\nverdure and eternal youth in the phrase, 'she will be so glad of the\nopportunity, I am sure!'\nIn the meantime, Mrs Podsnap, unable to originate a mistake on her\nown account, because Mrs Veneering is the only other lady there, does\nher best in the way of handsomely supporting her husband's, by\nlooking towards Mr Twemlow with a plaintive countenance and\nremarking to Mrs Veneering in a feeling manner, firstly, that she fears\nhe has been rather bilious of late, and, secondly, that the baby is\nalready very like him.\nIt is questionable whether any man quite relishes being mistaken for\nany other man; but, Mr Veneering having this very evening set up the\nshirt-front of the young Antinous in new worked cambric just come\nhome, is not at all complimented by being supposed to be Twemlow,\nwho is dry and weazen and some thirty years older. Mrs Veneering\nequally resents the imputation of being the wife of Twemlow. As to\nTwemlow, he is so sensible of being a much better bred man than\nVeneering, that he considers the large man an offensive ass.\nIn this complicated dilemma, Mr Veneering approaches the large man\nwith extended hand and, smilingly assures that incorrigible personage\nthat he is delighted to see him: who in his fatal\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TWEMLOW<|>PERSON<|>Twemlow is a character who is frequently invited to dine with Veneering and his acquaintances)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VENEERING<|>PERSON<|>Veneering is a socialite who frequently hosts dinners and has many acquaintances)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS VENEERING<|>PERSON<|>Mrs. Veneering is the wife of Veneering and is very affectionate towards her guests)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR BOOTS<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Boots is one of Veneering's friends introduced to Twemlow)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR BREWER<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Brewer is another one of Veneering's friends introduced to Twemlow)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PODSNAP<|>PERSON<|>Podsnap is a large man with a fresh appearance who is very eager to socialize)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS PODSNAP<|>PERSON<|>Mrs. Podsnap is the wife of Podsnap and supports her husband's social interactions)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWEMLOW<|>VENEERING<|>Twemlow frequently dines with Veneering and his acquaintances<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWEMLOW<|>MRS VENEERING<|>Mrs. Veneering welcomes Twemlow warmly at their social gatherings<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VENEERING<|>MRS VENEERING<|>Veneering and Mrs. Veneering are married and host social gatherings together<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWEMLOW<|>MR BOOTS<|>Twemlow is introduced to Mr. Boots by Veneering<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWEMLOW<|>MR BREWER<|>Twemlow is introduced to Mr. Brewer by Veneering<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWEMLOW<|>PODSNAP<|>Podsnap eagerly socializes with Twemlow at a dinner<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PODSNAP<|>MRS PODSNAP<|>Podsnap and Mrs. Podsnap are married and attend social gatherings together<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
