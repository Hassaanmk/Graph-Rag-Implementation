His arms were wet and dirty, and he washed them over the side.\nIn his right hand he held something, and he washed that in the river\ntoo. It was money. He chinked it once, and he blew upon it once, and\nhe spat upon it once, - 'for luck,' he hoarsely said - before he put it in\nhis pocket.\n'Lizzie!'\nThe girl turned her face towards him with a start, and rowed in\nsilence. Her face was very pale. He was a hook-nosed man, and with\nthat and his bright eyes and his ruffled head, bore a certain likeness\nto a roused bird of prey.\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n6\n'Take that thing off your face.'\nShe put it back.\n'Here! and give me hold of the sculls. I'll take the rest of the spell.'\n'No, no, father! No! I can't indeed. Father! - I cannot sit so near it!'\nHe was moving towards her to change places, but her terrified\nexpostulation stopped him and he resumed his seat.\n'What hurt can it do you?'\n'None, none. But I cannot bear it.'\n'It's my belief you hate the sight of the very river.'\n'I - I do not like it, father.'\n'As if it wasn't your living! As if it wasn't meat and drink to you!'\nAt these latter words the girl shivered again, and for a moment paused\nin her rowing, seeming to turn deadly faint. It escaped his attention,\nfor he was glancing over the stern at something the boat had in tow.\n'How can you be so thankless to your best friend, Lizzie? The very fire\nthat warmed you when you were a babby, was picked out of the river\nalongside the coal barges. The very basket that you slept in, the tide\nwashed ashore. The very rockers that I put it upon to make a cradle of\nit, I cut out of a piece of wood that drifted from some ship or another.'\nLizzie took her right hand from the scull it held, and touched her lips\nwith it, and for a moment held it out lovingly towards him: then,\nwithout speaking, she resumed her rowing, as another boat of similar\nappearance, though in rather better trim, came out from a dark place\nand dropped softly alongside.\n'In luck again, Gaffer?' said a man with a squinting leer, who sculled\nher and who was alone, 'I know'd you was in luck again, by your wake\nas you come down.'\n'Ah!' replied the other, drily. 'So you're out, are you?'\n'Yes, pardner.'\nThere was now a tender yellow moonlight on the river, and the new\ncomer, keeping half his boat's length astern of the other boat looked\nhard at its track.\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n7\n'I says to myself,' he went on, 'directly you hove in view, yonder's\nGaffer, and in luck again, by George if he ain't! Scull it is, pardner -\ndon't fret yourself - I didn't touch him.' This was in answer to a quick\nimpatient movement on the part of Gaffer: the speaker at the same\ntime unshipping his scull on that side, and laying his hand on the\ngunwale of Gaffer's boat and holding to it.\n'He's had touches enough not to want no more, as well as I make him\nout, Gaffer! Been a knocking about with a pretty many tides, ain't he\npardner? Such is my out-of-luck ways, you see! He must have passed\nme when he went up last time, for I was on the lookout below bridge\nhere. I a'most think you're like the wulturs, pardner, and scent 'em\nout.'\nHe spoke in a dropped voice, and with more than one glance at Lizzie\nwho had pulled on her hood again. Both men then looked with a weird\nunholy interest in the wake of Gaffer's boat.\n'Easy does it, betwixt us. Shall I take him aboard, pardner?'\n'No,' said the other. In so surly a tone that the man, after a blank\nstare, acknowledged it with the retort:\n' - Arn't been eating nothing as has disagreed with you, have you,\npardner?'\n'Why, yes, I have,' said Gaffer. 'I have been swallowing too much of\nthat word, Pardner. I am no pardner of yours.'\n'Since when was you no pardner of mine, Gaffer Hexam Esquire?'\n'Since you was accused of robbing a man. Accused of robbing a live\nman!' said Gaffer, with great indignation. 'And what if I had been\naccused of robbing a dead man, Gaffer?'\n'You COULDN'T do it.'\n'Couldn't you, Gaffer?'\n'No. Has a dead man any use for money? Is it possible for a dead man\nto have money? What world does a dead man belong to? 'Tother world.\nWhat world does money belong to? This world. How can money be a\ncorpse's? Can a corpse own it, want it, spend it, claim it, miss it?\nDon't try to go confounding the rights and wrongs of things in that\nway. But it's worthy of the sneaking spirit that robs a live man.'\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GAFFER HEXAM<|>PERSON<|>Gaffer Hexam is a hook-nosed man with bright eyes and a ruffled head, who appears to be involved in some shady activities on the river)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIZZIE<|>PERSON<|>Lizzie is Gaffer Hexam's daughter, who is pale and seems terrified of something in the boat)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIVER<|>GEO<|>The river is the setting where Gaffer Hexam and Lizzie are rowing their boat and conducting their activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARTNER<|>PERSON<|>Partner is a man with a squinting leer who interacts with Gaffer Hexam and seems to be involved in similar activities)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAFFER HEXAM<|>LIZZIE<|>Gaffer Hexam is Lizzie's father and they are rowing a boat together on the river<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAFFER HEXAM<|>PARTNER<|>Gaffer Hexam and Partner are involved in some kind of partnership, although Gaffer denies being his partner<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAFFER HEXAM<|>RIVER<|>Gaffer Hexam conducts his activities on the river<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIZZIE<|>RIVER<|>Lizzie is rowing a boat on the river with her father, Gaffer Hexam<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
