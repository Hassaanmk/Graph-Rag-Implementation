The\ngirl rowed, pulling a pair of sculls very easily; the man, with the\nrudder-lines slack in his hands, and his hands loose in his waistband,\nkept an eager look out. He had no net, hook, or line, and he could not\nbe a fisherman; his boat had no cushion for a sitter, no paint, no\ninscription, no appliance beyond a rusty boathook and a coil of rope,\nand he could not be a waterman; his boat was too crazy and too small\nto take in cargo for delivery, and he could not be a lighterman or rivercarrier; there was no clue to what he looked for, but he looked for\nsomething, with a most intent and searching gaze. The tide, which\nhad turned an hour before, was running down, and his eyes watched\nevery little race and eddy in its broad sweep, as the boat made slight\nhead-way against it, or drove stern foremost before it, according as he\ndirected his daughter by a movement of his head. She watched his\nface as earnestly as he watched the river. But, in the intensity of her\nlook there was a touch of dread or horror.\nAllied to the bottom of the river rather than the surface, by reason of\nthe slime and ooze with which it was covered, and its sodden state,\nthis boat and the two figures in it obviously were doing something that\nthey often did, and were seeking what they often sought. Half savage\nas the man showed, with no covering on his matted head, with his\nbrown arms bare to between the elbow and the shoulder, with the\nloose knot of a looser kerchief lying low on his bare breast in a\nwilderness of beard and whisker, with such dress as he wore seeming\nto be made out of the mud that begrimed his boat, still there was a\nbusiness-like usage in his steady gaze. So with every lithe action of\nthe girl, with every turn of her wrist, perhaps most of all with her look\nof dread or horror; they were things of usage.\n'Keep her out, Lizzie. Tide runs strong here. Keep her well afore the\nsweep of it.'\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n5\nTrusting to the girl's skill and making no use of the rudder, he eyed\nthe coming tide with an absorbed attention. So the girl eyed him. But,\nit happened now, that a slant of light from the setting sun glanced\ninto the bottom of the boat, and, touching a rotten stain there which\nbore some resemblance to the outline of a muffled human form,\ncoloured it as though with diluted blood. This caught the girl's eye,\nand she shivered.\n'What ails you?' said the man, immediately aware of it, though so\nintent on the advancing waters; 'I see nothing afloat.'\nThe red light was gone, the shudder was gone, and his gaze, which\nhad come back to the boat for a moment, travelled away again.\nWheresoever the strong tide met with an impediment, his gaze paused\nfor an instant. At every mooring-chain and rope, at every stationery\nboat or barge that split the current into a broad-arrowhead, at the\noffsets from the piers of Southwark Bridge, at the paddles of the river\nsteamboats as they beat the filthy water, at the floating logs of timber\nlashed together lying off certain wharves, his shining eyes darted a\nhungry look. After a darkening hour or so, suddenly the rudder-lines\ntightened in his hold, and he steered hard towards the Surrey shore.\nAlways watching his face, the girl instantly answered to the action in\nher sculling; presently the boat swung round, quivered as from a\nsudden jerk, and the upper half of the man was stretched out over the\nstern.\nThe girl pulled the hood of a cloak she wore, over her head and over\nher face, and, looking backward so that the front folds of this hood\nwere turned down the river, kept the boat in that direction going\nbefore the tide. Until now, the boat had barely held her own, and had\nhovered about one spot; but now, the banks changed swiftly, and the\ndeepening shadows and the kindling lights of London Bridge were\npassed, and the tiers of shipping lay on either hand.\nIt was not until now that the upper half of the man came back into the\nboat. His arms were wet and dirty, and he washed them over the side.\nIn his right hand he held something, and he washed that in the river\ntoo. It was money. He chinked it once, and he blew upon it once, and\nhe spat upon it once, - 'for luck,' he hoarsely said - before he put it in\nhis pocket.\n'Lizzie!'\nThe girl turned her face towards him with a start, and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
