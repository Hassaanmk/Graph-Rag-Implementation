Everything about the Veneerings was\nspick and span new. All their furniture was new, all their friends were\nnew, all their servants were new, their plate was new, their carriage\nwas new, their harness was new, their horses were new, their pictures\nwere new, they themselves were new, they were as newly married as\nwas lawfully compatible with their having a bran-new baby, and if\nthey had set up a great-grandfather, he would have come home in\nmatting from the Pantechnicon, without a scratch upon him, French\npolished to the crown of his head.\nFor, in the Veneering establishment, from the hall-chairs with the new\ncoat of arms, to the grand pianoforte with the new action, and\nupstairs again to the new fire-escape, all things were in a state of high\nvarnish and polish. And what was observable in the furniture, was\nobservable in the Veneerings - the surface smelt a little too much of\nthe workshop and was a trifle sticky.\nThere was an innocent piece of dinner-furniture that went upon easy\ncastors and was kept over a livery stable-yard in Duke Street, Saint\nJames's, when not in use, to whom the Veneerings were a source of\nblind confusion. The name of this article was Twemlow. Being first\ncousin to Lord Snigsworth, he was in frequent requisition, and at\nmany houses might be said to represent the dining-table in its normal\nstate. Mr and Mrs Veneering, for example, arranging a dinner,\nhabitually started with Twemlow, and then put leaves in him, or\nadded guests to him. Sometimes, the table consisted of Twemlow and\nhalf a dozen leaves; sometimes, of Twemlow and a dozen leaves;\nsometimes, Twemlow was pulled out to his utmost extent of twenty\nleaves. Mr and Mrs Veneering on occasions of ceremony faced each\nother in the centre of the board, and thus the parallel still held; for, it\nalways happened that the more Twemlow was pulled out, the further\nhe found himself from the center, and nearer to the sideboard at one\nend of the room, or the window-curtains at the other.\nBut, it was not this which steeped the feeble soul of Twemlow in\nconfusion. This he was used to, and could take soundings of. The\nabyss to which he could find no bottom, and from which started forth\nthe engrossing and ever-swelling difficulty of his life, was the insoluble\nquestion whether he was Veneering's oldest friend, or newest friend.\nTo the excogitation of this problem, the harmless gentleman had\ndevoted many anxious hours, both in his lodgings over the livery\nstable-yard, and in the cold gloom, favourable to meditation, of Saint\nJames's Square. Thus. Twemlow had first known Veneering at his\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n10\nclub, where Veneering then knew nobody but the man who made\nthem known to one another, who seemed to be the most intimate\nfriend he had in the world, and whom he had known two days - the\nbond of union between their souls, the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
