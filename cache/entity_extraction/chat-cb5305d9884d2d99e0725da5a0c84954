Mortimer is unable to report.\nMr Podsnap inquires what would become of the very large fortune, in\nthe event of the marriage condition not being fulfilled? Mortimer\nreplies, that by special testamentary clause it would then go to the old\nservant above mentioned, passing over and excluding the son; also,\nthat if the son had not been living, the same old servant would have\nbeen sole residuary legatee.\nMrs Veneering has just succeeded in waking Lady Tippins from a\nsnore, by dexterously shunting a train of plates and dishes at her\nknuckles across the table; when everybody but Mortimer himself\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n19\nbecomes aware that the Analytical Chemist is, in a ghostly manner,\noffering him a folded paper. Curiosity detains Mrs Veneering a few\nmoments.\nMortimer, in spite of all the arts of the chemist, placidly refreshes\nhimself with a glass of Madeira, and remains unconscious of the\nDocument which engrosses the general attention, until Lady Tippins\n(who has a habit of waking totally insensible), having remembered\nwhere she is, and recovered a perception of surrounding objects, says:\n'Falser man than Don Juan; why don't you take the note from the\ncommendatore?' Upon which, the chemist advances it under the nose\nof Mortimer, who looks round at him, and says:\n'What's this?'\nAnalytical Chemist bends and whispers.\n'WHO?' Says Mortimer.\nAnalytical Chemist again bends and whispers.\nMortimer stares at him, and unfolds the paper. Reads it, reads it\ntwice, turns it over to look at the blank outside, reads it a third time.\n'This arrives in an extraordinarily opportune manner,' says Mortimer\nthen, looking with an altered face round the table: 'this is the\nconclusion of the story of the identical man.'\n'Already married?' one guesses.\n'Declines to marry?' another guesses.\n'Codicil among the dust?' another guesses.\n'Why, no,' says Mortimer; 'remarkable thing, you are all wrong. The\nstory is completer and rather more exciting than I supposed. Man's\ndrowned!'\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n20\nChapter 3 - Another Man\nAs the disappearing skirts of the ladies ascended the Veneering\nstaircase, Mortimer, following them forth from the dining-room,\nturned into a library of bran-new books, in bran-new bindings\nliberally gilded, and requested to see the messenger who had brought\nthe paper. He was a boy of about fifteen. Mortimer looked at the boy,\nand the boy looked at the bran-new pilgrims on the wall, going to\nCanterbury in more gold frame than procession, and more carving\nthan country.\n'Whose writing is this?'\n'Mine, sir.'\n'Who told you to write it?'\n'My father, Jesse Hexam.'\n'Is it he who found the body?'\n'Yes, sir.'\n'What is your father?'\nThe boy hesitated, looked reproachfully at the pilgrims as if they had\ninvolved him in a little difficulty, then said, folding a plait in the right\nleg of his trousers, 'He gets his living along-shore.'\n'Is it far?'\n'Is which far?' asked the boy, upon his guard, and again upon the\nroad to Canterbury.\n'To your father's?'\n'It's a goodish stretch, sir. I come up in a cab, and the cab's waiting to\nbe paid. We could go back in it before you paid it, if you liked. I went\nfirst to your office, according to the direction of the papers found in\nthe pockets, and there I see nobody but a chap of about my age who\nsent me on here.'\nThere was a curious mixture in the boy, of uncompleted savagery, and\nuncompleted civilization. His voice was hoarse and coarse, and his\nface was coarse, and his stunted figure was coarse; but he was\ncleaner than other boys of his type; and his writing, though large and\nround, was good; and he glanced at the backs of the books, with an\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n21\nawakened curiosity that went below the binding. No one who can\nread, ever looks at a book, even unopened on a shelf, like one who\ncannot.\n'Were any means taken, do you know, boy, to ascertain if it was\npossible to restore life?' Mortimer inquired, as he sought for his hat.\n'You wouldn't ask, sir, if you knew his state. Pharaoh's multitude that\nwere drowned in the Red Sea, ain't more beyond restoring to life. If\nLazarus was only half as far gone, that was the greatest of all the\nmiracles.'\n'Halloa!' cried Mortimer, turning round with his hat upon his head,\n'you seem to be at home in the Red Sea, my young friend?'\n'Read of it with teacher at the school,' said the boy.\n'And Lazarus?'\n'Yes, and him too. But don't you tell my father! We should have no\npeace in our place, if that got touched upon.
