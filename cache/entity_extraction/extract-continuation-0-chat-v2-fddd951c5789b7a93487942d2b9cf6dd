But I\nam resolved to have the account of the man from Somewhere, and I\nbeg you to elicit it for me, my love,' to Mrs Veneering, 'as I have lost\nmy own influence. Oh, you perjured man!' This to Mortimer, with a\nrattle of her fan.\n'We are all very much interested in the man from Somewhere,'\nVeneering observes.\nThen the four Buffers, taking heart of grace all four at once, say:\n'Deeply interested!'\n'Quite excited!'\n'Dramatic!'\n'Man from Nowhere, perhaps!'\nAnd then Mrs Veneering - for the Lady Tippins's winning wiles are\ncontagious - folds her hands in the manner of a supplicating child,\nturns to her left neighbour, and says, 'Tease! Pay! Man from\nTumwhere!' At which the four Buffers, again mysteriously moved all\nfour at once, explain, 'You can't resist!'\n'Upon my life,' says Mortimer languidly, 'I find it immensely\nembarrassing to have the eyes of Europe upon me to this extent, and\nmy only consolation is that you will all of you execrate Lady Tippins in\nyour secret hearts when you find, as you inevitably will, the man from\nSomewhere a bore. Sorry to destroy romance by fixing him with a local\nhabitation, but he comes from the place, the name of which escapes\nme, but will suggest itself to everybody else here, where they make the\nwine.'\nEugene suggests 'Day and Martin's.'\n'No, not that place,' returns the unmoved Mortimer, 'that's where they\nmake the Port. My man comes from the country where they make the\nCape Wine. But look here, old fellow; its not at all statistical and it's\nrather odd.'\nIt is always noticeable at the table of the Veneerings, that no man\ntroubles himself much about the Veneerings themselves, and that any\none who has anything to tell, generally tells it to anybody else in\npreference.\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n16\n'The man,' Mortimer goes on, addressing Eugene, 'whose name is\nHarmon, was only son of a tremendous old rascal who made his\nmoney by Dust.'\n'Red velveteens and a bell?' the gloomy Eugene inquires.\n'And a ladder and basket if you like. By which means, or by others, he\ngrew rich as a Dust Contractor, and lived in a hollow in a hilly country\nentirely composed of Dust. On his own small estate the growling old\nvagabond threw up his own mountain range, like an old volcano, and\nits geological formation was Dust. Coal-dust, vegetable-dust, bonedust, crockery dust, rough dust and sifted dust, - all manner of Dust.'\nA passing remembrance of Mrs Veneering, here induces Mortimer to\naddress his next half-dozen words to her; after which he wanders\naway again, tries Twemlow and finds he doesn't answer, ultimately\ntakes up with the Buffers who receive him enthusiastically.\n'The moral being - I believe that's the right expression - of this\nexemplary person, derived its highest gratification from\nanathematizing his nearest relations and turning them out of doors.\nHaving begun (as was natural) by rendering these attentions to the\nwife of his bosom, he next found himself at leisure to bestow a similar\nrecognition on the claims of his daughter. He chose a husband for her,\nentirely to his own satisfaction and not in the least to hers, and\nproceeded to settle upon her, as her marriage portion, I don't know\nhow much Dust, but something immense. At this stage of the affair\nthe poor girl respectfully intimated that she was secretly engaged to\nthat popular character whom the novelists and versifiers call Another,\nand that such a marriage would make Dust of her heart and Dust of\nher life - in short, would set her up, on a very extensive scale, in her\nfather's business. Immediately, the venerable parent - on a cold\nwinter's night, it is said - anathematized and turned her out.'\nHere, the Analytical Chemist (who has evidently formed a very low\nopinion of Mortimer's story) concedes a little claret to the Buffers;\nwho, again mysteriously moved all four at once, screw it slowly into\nthemselves with a peculiar twist of enjoyment, as they cry in chorus,\n'Pray go on.'\n'The pecuniary resources of Another were, as they usually are, of a\nvery limited nature. I believe I am not using too strong an expression\nwhen I say that Another was hard up. However, he married the young\nlady, and they lived in a humble dwelling, probably possessing a\nporch ornamented with honeysuckle and woodbine twining, until she\ndied.
