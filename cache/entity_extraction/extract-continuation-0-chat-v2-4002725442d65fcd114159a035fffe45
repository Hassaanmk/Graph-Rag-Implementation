However, he married the young\nlady, and they lived in a humble dwelling, probably possessing a\nporch ornamented with honeysuckle and woodbine twining, until she\ndied. I must refer you to the Registrar of the District in which the\nhumble dwelling was situated, for the certified cause of death; but\nearly sorrow and anxiety may have had to do with it, though they may\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n17\nnot appear in the ruled pages and printed forms. Indisputably this\nwas the case with Another, for he was so cut up by the loss of his\nyoung wife that if he outlived her a year it was as much as he did.'\nThere is that in the indolent Mortimer, which seems to hint that if\ngood society might on any account allow itself to be impressible, he,\none of good society, might have the weakness to be impressed by what\nhe here relates. It is hidden with great pains, but it is in him. The\ngloomy Eugene too, is not without some kindred touch; for, when that\nappalling Lady Tippins declares that if Another had survived, he\nshould have gone down at the head of her list of lovers - and also\nwhen the mature young lady shrugs her epaulettes, and laughs at\nsome private and confidential comment from the mature young\ngentleman - his gloom deepens to that degree that he trifles quite\nferociously with his dessert-knife.\nMortimer proceeds.\n'We must now return, as novelists say, and as we all wish they\nwouldn't, to the man from Somewhere. Being a boy of fourteen,\ncheaply educated at Brussels when his sister's expulsion befell, it was\nsome little time before he heard of it - probably from herself, for the\nmother was dead; but that I don't know. Instantly, he absconded, and\ncame over here. He must have been a boy of spirit and resource, to get\nhere on a stopped allowance of five sous a week; but he did it\nsomehow, and he burst in on his father, and pleaded his sister's\ncause. Venerable parent promptly resorts to anathematization, and\nturns him out. Shocked and terrified boy takes flight, seeks his\nfortune, gets aboard ship, ultimately turns up on dry land among the\nCape wine: small proprietor, farmer, grower - whatever you like to call\nit.'\nAt this juncture, shuffling is heard in the hall, and tapping is heard at\nthe dining-room door. Analytical Chemist goes to the door, confers\nangrily with unseen tapper, appears to become mollified by descrying\nreason in the tapping, and goes out.\n'So he was discovered, only the other day, after having been\nexpatriated about fourteen years.'\nA Buffer, suddenly astounding the other three, by detaching himself,\nand asserting individuality, inquires: 'How discovered, and why?'\n'Ah! To be sure. Thank you for reminding me. Venerable parent dies.'\nSame Buffer, emboldened by success, says: 'When?'\n'The other day. Ten or twelve months ago.'\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n18\nSame Buffer inquires with smartness, 'What of?' But herein perishes a\nmelancholy example; being regarded by the three other Buffers with a\nstony stare, and attracting no further attention from any mortal.\n'Venerable parent,' Mortimer repeats with a passing remembrance that\nthere is a Veneering at table, and for the first time addressing him -\n'dies.'\nThe gratified Veneering repeats, gravely, 'dies'; and folds his arms, and\ncomposes his brow to hear it out in a judicial manner, when he finds\nhimself again deserted in the bleak world.\n'His will is found,' said Mortimer, catching Mrs Podsnap's rockinghorse's eye. 'It is dated very soon after the son's flight. It leaves the\nlowest of the range of dust-mountains, with some sort of a dwellinghouse at its foot, to an old servant who is sole executor, and all the\nrest of the property - which is very considerable - to the son. He\ndirects himself to be buried with certain eccentric ceremonies and\nprecautions against his coming to life, with which I need not bore you,\nand that's all - except - ' and this ends the story.\nThe Analytical Chemist returning, everybody looks at him. Not\nbecause anybody wants to see him, but because of that subtle\ninfluence in nature which impels humanity to embrace the slightest\nopportunity of looking at anything, rather than the person who\naddresses it.\n' - Except that the son's inheriting is made conditional on his\nmarrying a girl, who at the date of the will, was a child of four or five\nyears old, and who is now a marriageable young woman.\nAdvertisement and inquiry discovered the son in the man from\nSomewhere, and at the present moment, he is on his way home from\nthere - no doubt, in a state of great astonishment - to succeed to a\nvery large fortune, and to take a wife.'\nMrs Podsnap inquires whether the young person is a young person of\npersonal charms? Mortimer is unable to report.\nMr Podsnap inquires what would become of the very large fortune, in\nthe event of the marriage condition not being fulfilled?
