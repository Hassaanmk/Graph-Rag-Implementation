In and\nout among vessels that seemed to have got ashore, and houses that\nseemed to have got afloat - among bow-splits staring into windows,\nand windows staring into ships - the wheels rolled on, until they\nstopped at a dark corner, river-washed and otherwise not washed at\nall, where the boy alighted and opened the door.\n'You must walk the rest, sir; it's not many yards.' He spoke in the\nsingular number, to the express exclusion of Eugene.\n'This is a confoundedly out-of-the-way place,' said Mortimer, slipping\nover the stones and refuse on the shore, as the boy turned the corner\nsharp.\n'Here's my father's, sir; where the light is.'\nThe low building had the look of having once been a mill. There was a\nrotten wart of wood upon its forehead that seemed to indicate where\nthe sails had been, but the whole was very indistinctly seen in the\nobscurity of the night. The boy lifted the latch of the door, and they\npassed at once into a low circular room, where a man stood before a\nred fire, looking down into it, and a girl sat engaged in needlework.\nThe fire was in a rusty brazier, not fitted to the hearth; and a common\nlamp, shaped like a hyacinth-root, smoked and flared in the neck of a\nstone bottle on the table. There was a wooden bunk or berth in a\ncorner, and in another corner a wooden stair leading above - so\nclumsy and steep that it was little better than a ladder. Two or three\nold sculls and oars stood against the wall, and against another part of\nthe wall was a small dresser, making a spare show of the commonest\narticles of crockery and cooking-vessels. The roof of the room was not\nplastered, but was formed of the flooring of the room above. This,\nbeing very old, knotted, seamed, and beamed, gave a lowering aspect\nto the chamber; and roof, and walls, and floor, alike abounding in old\nsmears of flour, red-lead (or some such stain which it had probably\nacquired in warehousing), and damp, alike had a look of\ndecomposition.\n'The gentleman, father.'\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n24\nThe figure at the red fire turned, raised its ruffled head, and looked\nlike a bird of prey.\n'You're Mortimer Lightwood Esquire; are you, sir?'\n'Mortimer Lightwood is my name. What you found,' said Mortimer,\nglancing rather shrinkingly towards the bunk; 'is it here?'\n''Tain't not to say here, but it's close by. I do everything reg'lar. I've giv'\nnotice of the circumstarnce to the police, and the police have took\npossession of it. No time ain't been lost, on any hand. The police have\nput into print already, and here's what the print says of it.'\nTaking up the bottle with the lamp in it, he held it near a paper on the\nwall, with the police heading, BODY FOUND. The two friends read the\nhandbill as it stuck against the wall, and Gaffer read them as he held\nthe light.\n'Only papers on the unfortunate man, I see,' said Lightwood, glancing\nfrom the description of what was found, to the finder.\n'Only papers.'\nHere the girl arose with her work in her hand, and went out at the\ndoor.\n'No money,' pursued Mortimer; 'but threepence in one of the skirtpockets.'\n'Three. Penny. Pieces,' said Gaffer Hexam, in as many sentences.\n'The trousers pockets empty, and turned inside out.'\nGaffer Hexam nodded. 'But that's common. Whether it's the wash of\nthe tide or no, I can't say. Now, here,' moving the light to another\nsimilar placard, 'HIS pockets was found empty, and turned inside out.\nAnd here,' moving the light to another, 'HER pocket was found empty,\nand turned inside out. And so was this one's. And so was that one's. I\ncan't read, nor I don't want to it, for I know 'em by their places on the\nwall. This one was a sailor, with two anchors and a flag and G. F.
