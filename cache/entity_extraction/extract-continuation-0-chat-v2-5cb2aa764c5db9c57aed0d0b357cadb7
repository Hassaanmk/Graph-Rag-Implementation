Reflects mature young lady; raven locks, and complexion that\nlights up well when well powdered - as it is - carrying on considerably\nin the captivation of mature young gentleman; with too much nose in\nhis face, too much ginger in his whiskers, too much torso in his\nwaistcoat, too much sparkle in his studs, his eyes, his buttons, his\ntalk, and his teeth. Reflects charming old Lady Tippins on Veneering's\nright; with an immense obtuse drab oblong face, like a face in a\ntablespoon, and a dyed Long Walk up the top of her head, as a\nconvenient public approach to the bunch of false hair behind, pleased\nto patronize Mrs Veneering opposite, who is pleased to be patronized.\nReflects a certain 'Mortimer', another of Veneering's oldest friends;\nwho never was in the house before, and appears not to want to come\nagain, who sits disconsolate on Mrs Veneering's left, and who was\ninveigled by Lady Tippins (a friend of his boyhood) to come to these\npeople's and talk, and who won't talk. Reflects Eugene, friend of\nMortimer; buried alive in the back of his chair, behind a shoulder -\nwith a powder-epaulette on it - of the mature young lady, and gloomily\nresorting to the champagne chalice whenever proffered by the\nAnalytical Chemist. Lastly, the looking-glass reflects Boots and\nBrewer, and two other stuffed Buffers interposed between the rest of\nthe company and possible accidents.\nThe Veneering dinners are excellent dinners - or new people wouldn't\ncome - and all goes well. Notably, Lady Tippins has made a series of\nexperiments on her digestive functions, so extremely complicated and\ndaring, that if they could be published with their results it might\nbenefit the human race. Having taken in provisions from all parts of\nthe world, this hardy old cruiser has last touched at the North Pole,\nwhen, as the ice-plates are being removed, the following words fall\nfrom her:\n'I assure you, my dear Veneering - '\n(Poor Twemlow's hand approaches his forehead, for it would seem\nnow, that Lady Tippins is going to be the oldest friend.)\n'I assure you, my dear Veneering, that it is the oddest affair! Like the\nadvertising people, I don't ask you to trust me, without offering a\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n14\nrespectable reference. Mortimer there, is my reference, and knows all\nabout it.'\nMortimer raises his drooping eyelids, and slightly opens his mouth.\nBut a faint smile, expressive of 'What's the use!' passes over his face,\nand he drops his eyelids and shuts his mouth.\n'Now, Mortimer,' says Lady Tippins, rapping the sticks of her closed\ngreen fan upon the knuckles of her left hand - which is particularly\nrich in knuckles, 'I insist upon your telling all that is to be told about\nthe man from Jamaica.'\n'Give you my honour I never heard of any man from Jamaica, except\nthe man who was a brother,' replies Mortimer.\n'Tobago, then.'\n'Nor yet from Tobago.'\n'Except,' Eugene strikes in: so unexpectedly that the mature young\nlady, who has forgotten all about him, with a start takes the epaulette\nout of his way: 'except our friend who long lived on rice-pudding and\nisinglass, till at length to his something or other, his physician said\nsomething else, and a leg of mutton somehow ended in daygo.'\nA reviving impression goes round the table that Eugene is coming out.\nAn unfulfilled impression, for he goes in again.\n'Now, my dear Mrs Veneering,' quoth Lady Tippins, I appeal to you\nwhether this is not the basest conduct ever known in this world? I\ncarry my lovers about, two or three at a time, on condition that they\nare very obedient and devoted; and here is my oldest lover-in-chief,\nthe head of all my slaves, throwing off his allegiance before company!\nAnd here is another of my lovers, a rough Cymon at present certainly,\nbut of whom I had most hopeful expectations as to his turning out\nwell in course of time, pretending that he can't remember his nursery\nrhymes! On purpose to annoy me, for he knows how I doat upon\nthem!'\nA grisly little fiction concerning her lovers is Lady Tippins's point. She\nis always attended by a lover or two, and she keeps a little list of her\nlovers, and she is always booking a new lover, or striking out an old\nlover, or putting a lover in her black list, or promoting a lover to her\nblue list, or adding up her lovers, or otherwise posting her book. Mrs\nVeneering is charmed by the humour, and so is Veneering. Perhaps it\nis enhanced by a certain yellow play in Lady Tippins's throat, like the\nlegs of scratching poultry.\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n15\n'I banish the false wretch from this moment, and I strike him out of\nmy Cupidon (my name for my Ledger, my dear,) this very night.
