Mrs Veneering\nequally resents the imputation of being the wife of Twemlow. As to\nTwemlow, he is so sensible of being a much better bred man than\nVeneering, that he considers the large man an offensive ass.\nIn this complicated dilemma, Mr Veneering approaches the large man\nwith extended hand and, smilingly assures that incorrigible personage\nthat he is delighted to see him: who in his fatal freshness instantly\nreplies:\n'Thank you. I am ashamed to say that I cannot at this moment recall\nwhere we met, but I am so glad of this opportunity, I am sure!' Then\npouncing upon Twemlow, who holds back with all his feeble might, he\nis haling him off to present him, as Veneering, to Mrs Podsnap, when\nthe arrival of more guests unravels the mistake. Whereupon, having\nre-shaken hands with Veneering as Veneering, he re-shakes hands\nwith Twemlow as Twemlow, and winds it all up to his own perfect\nsatisfaction by saying to the last-named, 'Ridiculous opportunity - but\nso glad of it, I am sure!'\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n12\nNow, Twemlow having undergone this terrific experience, having\nlikewise noted the fusion of Boots in Brewer and Brewer in Boots, and\nhaving further observed that of the remaining seven guests four\ndiscrete characters enter with wandering eyes and wholly declined to\ncommit themselves as to which is Veneering, until Veneering has\nthem in his grasp; - Twemlow having profited by these studies, finds\nhis brain wholesomely hardening as he approaches the conclusion\nthat he really is Veneering's oldest friend, when his brain softens\nagain and all is lost, through his eyes encountering Veneering and the\nlarge man linked together as twin brothers in the back drawing-room\nnear the conservatory door, and through his ears informing him in the\ntones of Mrs Veneering that the same large man is to be baby's\ngodfather.\n'Dinner is on the table!'\nThus the melancholy retainer, as who should say, 'Come down and be\npoisoned, ye unhappy children of men!'\nTwemlow, having no lady assigned him, goes down in the rear, with\nhis hand to his forehead. Boots and Brewer, thinking him indisposed,\nwhisper, 'Man faint. Had no lunch.' But he is only stunned by the\nunvanquishable difficulty of his existence.\nRevived by soup, Twemlow discourses mildly of the Court Circular\nwith Boots and Brewer. Is appealed to, at the fish stage of the\nbanquet, by Veneering, on the disputed question whether his cousin\nLord Snigsworth is in or out of town? Gives it that his cousin is out of\ntown. 'At Snigsworthy Park?' Veneering inquires. 'At Snigsworthy,'\nTwemlow rejoins. Boots and Brewer regard this as a man to be\ncultivated; and Veneering is clear that he is a remunerative article.\nMeantime the retainer goes round, like a gloomy Analytical Chemist:\nalways seeming to say, after 'Chablis, sir?' - 'You wouldn't if you knew\nwhat it's made of.'\nThe great looking-glass above the sideboard, reflects the table and the\ncompany. Reflects the new Veneering crest, in gold and eke in silver,\nfrosted and also thawed, a camel of all work. The Heralds' College\nfound out a Crusading ancestor for Veneering who bore a camel on his\nshield (or might have done it if he had thought of it), and a caravan of\ncamels take charge of the fruits and flowers and candles, and kneel\ndown be loaded with the salt. Reflects Veneering; forty, wavy-haired,\ndark, tending to corpulence, sly, mysterious, filmy - a kind of\nsufficiently well-looking veiled-prophet, not prophesying. Reflects Mrs\nVeneering; fair, aquiline-nosed and fingered, not so much light hair as\nshe might have, gorgeous in raiment and jewels, enthusiastic,\npropitiatory, conscious that a corner of her husband's veil is over\nherself. Reflects Podsnap; prosperously feeding, two little light-\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com\n13\ncoloured wiry wings, one on either side of his else bald head, looking\nas like his hairbrushes as his hair, dissolving view of red beads on his\nforehead, large allowance of crumpled shirt-collar up behind. Reflects\nMrs Podsnap; fine woman for Professor Owen, quantity of bone, neck\nand nostrils like a rocking-horse, hard features, majestic head-dress\nin which Podsnap has hung golden offerings. Reflects Twemlow; grey,\ndry, polite, susceptible to east wind, First-Gentleman-in-Europe collar\nand cravat, cheeks drawn in as if he had made a great effort to retire\ninto himself some years ago, and had got so far and had never got any\nfarther. Reflects mature young lady; raven locks, and complexion that\nlights up well when well powdered - as it is - carrying on considerably\nin the captivation of mature young gentleman; with too much nose in\nhis face, too much ginger in his whiskers, too much torso in his\nwaistcoat, too much sparkle in his\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MRS VENEERING<|>PERSON<|>Mrs Veneering is the wife of Mr Veneering, described as fair, aquiline-nosed, and enthusiastic, adorned in gorgeous raiment and jewels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TWEMLOW<|>PERSON<|>Twemlow is a polite, grey, dry man, susceptible to the east wind, and considered to be a better-bred man than Veneering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR VENEERING<|>PERSON<|>Mr Veneering is a forty-year-old man with wavy dark hair, tending to corpulence, and described as sly and mysterious)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS PODSNAP<|>PERSON<|>Mrs Podsnap is a fine woman with a quantity of bone, neck and nostrils like a rocking-horse, and hard features, adorned with a majestic head-dress)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PODSNAP<|>PERSON<|>Podsnap is a man with two little light-coloured wiry wings on either side of his otherwise bald head, with a large allowance of crumpled shirt-collar up behind)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOOTS<|>PERSON<|>Boots is a guest at the dinner who is involved in conversations with Twemlow and Brewer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREWER<|>PERSON<|>Brewer is a guest at the dinner who is involved in conversations with Twemlow and Boots)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LORD SNIGSWORTH<|>PERSON<|>Lord Snigsworth is Twemlow's cousin, who is mentioned in a conversation about whether he is in or out of town)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNIGSWORTHY PARK<|>GEO<|>Snigsworthy Park is the location where Lord Snigsworth is said to be)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HERALDS' COLLEGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heralds' College is the institution that found a Crusading ancestor for Veneering who bore a camel on his shield)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANALYTICAL CHEMIST<|>PERSON<|>The retainer at the dinner, who goes around serving wine and seems to imply that the guests wouldn't drink it if they knew what it was made of)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MR VENEERING<|>MRS VENEERING<|>Mr Veneering and Mrs Veneering are married<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWEMLOW<|>MR VENEERING<|>Twemlow considers himself to be a better-bred man than Mr Veneering<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWEMLOW<|>MRS VENEERING<|>Twemlow is mistakenly presented to Mrs Podsnap as Mr Veneering by the large man<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWEMLOW<|>PODSNAP<|>Twemlow and Podsnap are both guests at the dinner<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWEMLOW<|>BOOTS<|>Twemlow discourses mildly with Boots about the Court Circular<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWEMLOW<|>BREWER<|>Twemlow discourses mildly with Brewer about the Court Circular<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWEMLOW<|>LORD SNIGSWORTH<|>Twemlow mentions that Lord Snigsworth is his cousin<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LORD SNIGSWORTH<|>SNIGSWORTHY PARK<|>Lord Snigsworth is said to be at Snigsworthy Park<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HERALDS' COLLEGE<|>MR VENEERING<|>Heralds' College found a Crusading ancestor for Mr Veneering<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANALYTICAL CHEMIST<|>MR VENEERING<|>The Analytical Chemist serves wine at Mr Veneering's dinner<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANALYTICAL CHEMIST<|>MRS VENEERING<|>The Analytical Chemist serves wine at Mrs Veneering's dinner<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
